    <p>Hi!</p>

    <p>This is where I keep my personal profile, such as my projects, contest highlights, and résumé.  There may also be some
        'fun' things on this site added in the future.
    <hr>

    <p>Currently, I'm heading into my first year as a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo and I'm
        excited to deepen my knowledge of computer science and mathematics.
        Previously, I spent much of my high school career on competitive programming, solving over 2,000 problems in training
        and competition.</p>

    <p>I hope you stick around and check out some of the things here!</p>
