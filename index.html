    <p>Hi!</p>

    <p>I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo currently in my 2A term.</p>

    <p>I came into the program with a passion for computer science and mathematics.  However, university has also allowed me to explore
        myself mentally and emotionally, and I'm taking my time to fill out many of the experiences I missed during
        high school and due to the pandemic.</p>

    <p>On this website, you'll find my RÃ©sume, contest history, projects, and a blog of sorts. Most of the posts
        are CS-related, but there might be some others in the future. As they say: only time can tell.</p>
