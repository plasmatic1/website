    <p>Hi!</p>

    <p>I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo soon starting my 3B term. Currently, I'm interning
        at D. E. Shaw & Co., a Quantitative Trading firm based in New York.
</body>

<p>I'm passionate about many things, from computer science and mathematics to music. University has
    allowed me to explore these interests through a variety of courses, programs, and activities.</p>

<p>On this website, you'll find my Résumé, contest history, projects, and a few blog posts. Hopefully you'll
    stick around and check out a few things :)</p>

<p>Some activities at UW that I've had the pleasure of being a part of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In the 2021, 2022, and 2023 school years, I was a member of Waterloo's ACM-ICPC teams, scoring 4th, 6th, and 4th
        at the ECNA regionals</li>
    <li>Since May 2022 I've been a contributor to the CCC/CCO, Canada's national informatics olympiad. I was also a
        houseparent for the Canadian IOI 2022 Training Camp</li>
