    <p>Hi!</p>

    <p>This is where I keep my personal profile, such as my projects, contest highlights, and résumé.  There may also be some
        'fun' things on this site added in the future.
    <hr>

    <p>Currently, I'm a first year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo and I'm
        excited to deepen my knowledge of computer science and mathematics.</p>

    <p>
        Previously, I spent much of my high school career on competitive programming, and I plan to continue competing in
        University with the ACM-ICPC.  I'm a member of the Waterloo Black team for the 2022 ICPC competitions, so
        maybe I'll see some of you in the future!
    </p>

    <p>I hope you stick around and check out some of the things here!</p>
