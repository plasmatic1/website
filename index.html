    <p>Hi!</p>

    <p>I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo soon starting my 3A term.</body>

    <p>I'm passionate about many things, from computer science and mathematics to music.  University has
        allowed me to explore these interests through a variety of courses, programs, and activities.</p>

    <p>On this website, you'll find my Résumé, contest history, projects, and a few blog posts.  Hopefully you'll
        stick around and check out a few things :)</p>

    <p>Some activities at UW that I've had the pleasure of being a part of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the 2021 and 2022 school years, I was a member of Waterloo's ACM-ICPC teams, scoring 4th and 6th at the ECNA regionals</li>
        <li>Since May 2022 I've been a contributor to the CCC/CCO, Canada's national informatics olympiad.  I was also a houseparent for the Canadian IOI 2022 Training Camp</li>
