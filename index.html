    <p>Hi!</p>

    <p>I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo currently in my 2A term.</p>

    <p>I'm passionate about many things: from computer science and mathematics to music.  University has
        allowed me to explore not only my passions but also socially and emotionally, and has led me to many new
        discoveries and realizations.</p>

    <p>On this website, you'll find my RÃ©sume, contest history, projects, and a blog of sorts. Most of the posts
        are CS-related, but I also want to blog about more personal and miscellaneous things in the future.</p>

        <li>Contributor to the 2022 CCO and houseparent for the 2022 Canadian IOI Training Camp</li>
