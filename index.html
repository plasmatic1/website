    <p>Hi!</p>

    <p>This is where I keep my personal profile, such as my projects, contest history, and résumé.  I might also add
        some fun stuff in the future :) </p>

    <hr>

    <p>Currently, I'm heading into my first year as a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo and I'm
        super excited to deepen my knowledge of computer science and mathematics as I make the transition into university life.</p>

    <p>I hope you stick around and check out some of the things here!</p>

    <p>There are also a few sub-sites here.  Feel free to check them out!</p>
