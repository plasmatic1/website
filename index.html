<p>Hi!</p>

<p>I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. Currently, I'm 
    a research assistant at the <a href="https://mc.uwaterloo.ca/">UW Multicore Lab</a>, working on concurrent data structures. This summer, I'll be 
    working at <a href="https://radixtrading.co">Radix Trading</a> as a Quantitative Technologist Intern.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about many things, from computer science and mathematics to music. University has
    allowed me to explore these interests through a variety of courses, programs, and activities.</p>

<p>On this website, you'll find my projects, contest history, and a few blog posts. Hopefully you'll
    stick around and check out a few things :)</p>

<p>Some activities at UW that I've had the pleasure of being a part of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In the 2021, 2022, and 2023 school years, I was a member of Waterloo's ACM-ICPC teams, scoring 4th, 6th, and 4th
        at the ECNA regionals</li>
    <li>Since May 2022 I've been an organizer of the <a href="https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/ccc">Canadian Computing Competition (CCC)</a>, 
        Canada's largest programming competition and the selection test for Canada's team for the
        <a href="https://ioinformatics.org/">International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)</a>. Some of my past activities include authoring problems
        for the CCC and CCO (such as <a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc23s4">CCC '23 S4</a>), and houseparenting for the 2022 Canadian IOI training camp.
