## Competitive Programming

### Competitive Programming Tools

A suite of competitive programming tools, including a system for automated execution of code on test case, automatic
fetching of templates, and stress-testing.  There is also support for a variety of different generators and custom checkers.

Currently, there exists two versions of the tool, the original being a VSCode extension, and the current one being a console-based
Python module that can be easily integrated into existing text editors and IDEs such as Vim.  Below are the links to their respective
repositories:

* {% include repo_link.html name="cp-tools-console" label="Python Module" %}
* {% include repo_link.html name="competitive-programming-tools" label="VSCode Extension" %}

### Judge Solutions

I maintain a list of over 2,000 of my solutions that others can browse if they are stuck or want to see alternatives implementations of a problem ðŸ˜Š

* {% include repo_link.html name="dmoj-solutions" %}
* {% include repo_link.html name="other-judge-solutions" %}

### Templates

A codebook using [online-judge-tools/verification-helper](https://github.com/online-judge-tools/verification-helper) to
ensure correctness of algorithms and generate documentation.

The templates are designed to be "plug-and-play", meaning that their source code need not be modified for use.

* {% include repo_link.html name="templates" %}

### Miscellaneous/Planned

* Competition Environment
    * For competitions and practice, I use a customized [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) setup with many plugins.  Full configuration and setup script can be found on
        {% include repo_link.html name="competitive-programming-dotfiles" label="Github" %}.
* Auto CPP
  * Tool that automatically downloads submissions on problems and sends them through [MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) to help catch cheaters.
  * {% include repo_link.html name="autocpp" %}
* Rating badges
  * Rating SVG badges for your GitHub about page (or anywhere else that accepts them).
  * {% include repo_link.html name="judge-badge" %}
* (Planned) Solution Downloader
  * I have plans for a more comprehensive solution downloader that can aggregate solutions from many different judges into a searchable repository

<!-- ### Planned -->
<!-- * Generator-Lib -->
<!--   * A generator suite compatible with `testlib.h` that has helpers to generate more complex data such as graphs. -->
<!-- * DMOJ-Polygon -->
<!--   * An idea I have to help port Polygon packages into files compatible with the DMOJ judge. -->

## Website

What you're reading right now :).  This static website is made with Jekyll, with some Python scripts to fetch additional data.

The services are hosted in Docker containers on a VPS, with routing done via an NGINX reverse proxy.

* {% include repo_link.html name="website" %}

<!-- An old version of my site is available {% include repo_link.html name="website-old" label="here" %} as well. -->

## Minecraft

Previously, I made a few server plugins using the Bukkit/Spigot API.  Minecraft has and will always be one of my favourite games,
and is the source of much of my early programming experience.

* KitsPlus
  * A Bukkit/Spigot plugin that implements a robust interface for KitPVP
  * {% include repo_link.html name="kitsplus2" %} - V2 rewritten in Kotlin
  * {% include repo_link.html name="IntellijProjects" %} - Original contained within this repository
* Discord Bridge
  * A bridge service that connects Minecraft server chat to discord
  * {% include repo_link.html name="DiscordChat" host="gitlab" username="FrostTaco" %}
* IntelliJ Projects
  * A compilation of most of my older plugin projects, all contained within one repository because they shared some common files :P
  * {% include repo_link.html name="IntellijProjects" %}
