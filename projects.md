## Competitive Programming

As a competitive programmer, naturally I have many related projects.

### Competitive Programming Tools

A suite of competitive programming tools, including a system for automated execution of code on test case, automatic
fetching of templates, and stress-testing.  There is also support for a variety of different generators and custom checkers.

Currently, there exists two versions of the tool, the original being a VSCode extension, and the current one being a console-based
Python module that can be easily integrated into existing text editors and IDEs such as Vim.  Below are the links to their respective
repositories.

* {% include repo_link.html name="cp-tools-console" label="Python Module" %}
* {% include repo_link.html name="competitive-programming-tools" label="VSCode Extension" %}

#### Competition Environment

For competitions and practice, I use a customized [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) setup with many plugins.  Full configuration and setup script can be found on
{% include repo_link.html name="competitive-programming-dotfiles" label="Github" %}.

### Judge Solutions

I maintain a list of most of my judge solutions that others can browse if they are stuck or want to see alternatives implementations of a problem ðŸ˜Š

* {% include repo_link.html name="dmoj-solutions" %}
* {% include repo_link.html name="other-judge-solutions" %}

#### Solution Downloader

One of my planned projects is a solution downloader that can aggregate code from many different judges, removing the need to manually organize solutions.
Unfortunately, it's currently still in development.

### Templates

Recently, I've begun work on a more formal codebook using [online-judge-tools/verification-helper](https://github.com/online-judge-tools/verification-helper) to
 ensure correctness of algorithms and generate documentation.

* {% include repo_link.html name="templates" %}

### Misc.

* Auto CPP
  * Tool that automatically downloads submissions on problems and sends them through [MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) to help catch cheaters.
  * {% include repo_link.html name="autocpp" %}
* Rating badges
  * Rating SVG badges for your GitHub about page (or anywhere else that accepts them).  However, currently only DMOJ is supported.
  * {% include repo_link.html name="dmoj-rating-badges" %}
* Generators
  * I also maintain a semi-complete list of generator files I've used.  The repository is currently private but may be made public in the future.
* DMOJ-Polygon
  * An idea I have to help port Polygon packages into files compatible with the DMOJ judge.
