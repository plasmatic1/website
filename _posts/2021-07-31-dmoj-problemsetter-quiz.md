I figured that making a guide for the problemsetter
While most of the questions can be solved with mostly external knowledge, I thought it still might help to write a guide
 on how to do each question.  When possible, I'll try not to give direct answers to questions when possible, but
pointing out things directly is sometimes necessary.

Of course, you can always clone a copy of the DMOJ judge and set it up themselves to find the answer to everything, but
I find this quite unnecessary especially if you aren't planning on contributing to the codebase of the judge in the
future (or otherwise need a clone for the judge, such as for an extenal competition).

And... that's it :)

Hope this guide was useful to those who needed it!
